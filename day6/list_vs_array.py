1. array meaning in english is: ordered collection of items

2. list meaning in python is: ordered collection of items

- In c , c++, java: array is there and we can store only 1 kind of data.
  i.e. suppose if we want to store integer can only store that & can't combine with float or string.
  Either store int, string, float or any kind of data. it can only store that particular kind of data only

- In python's list: It can store any kind of data. means string, float, int all together

- Python also has a module called 'array module', can use this module by importing. but there also we can store fix data type only.
  means can store only 1 kind of data type. Python's data science libraries are actually binded with C libraries.

- In data science, we use numpy modules and in that we use numpy arrays. numpy arrays binding is with C, it means its very fast.

- we can also create bridge b/w python and C. It means we can get flexibility like Python and performance like C

*** - So, list is flexible and we use list more. but performance of python 'array module' is good but we don't use it.

1 more point, javascript's array is almost same like python's list.

In python we use List not the python's 'array module'
