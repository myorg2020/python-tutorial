age = int(age) # Converting string into number, as in python everything we take as input in string.
if age >= 14:  # Always use colon (:) here
    print("Your are above 14") # Always give space in next line, use "tab" is called indentation in python

# The reason why use space/tab here in python because in other languages we use statement within {} and it takes care.
# if age >= 14 {
