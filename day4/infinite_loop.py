#sometime by mistake we run infinite loop, like below. suppose we don't write line #8. it will go in infinite loop

# i = 0
# while i <= 10:
#     print("hello world")
#     i += 1


# suppose if want to intentionally write infinite loop, use:

while True:
    print("Hello World")

# There 2 binaries in python: True and False
# The why we write True above is becoz, in normal programm we write as: # while i <= 10:
# it executes if condition i.e. i <= 10 is true
