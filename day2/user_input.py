# To take input from user, use input function

name = input ("Enter your name: ")
# print(name)
print("Hello" + " " + name)

# input function always take input in string, means taking a number in double quote is like taking it in string.

age = input ("Enter your Age: ")
# print(age)
print("My age is " + age) # Here 2 strings are getting added as age variable we have taken input in string
